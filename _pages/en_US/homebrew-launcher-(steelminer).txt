### Required Reading

To install boot9strap on your 11.9.0 device, we exploit an oversight in the security restrictions applied to "DSiWare" applications.

Every 3DS system comes with DSiWare applications pre-installed. This method exploits this by using DS Download Play.

To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the DSiWare encryption key (`movable.sed`) for your device.

We then use this DSiWare encryption key with the Frogtool app to inject the Japanese version of Flipnote Studio into the DS Download Play app. 
Frogtool also installs an exploit for Flipnote Studio to run our custom code.

In order to utilize the injection app, Frogtool, we need Homebrew Launcher access. In this guide we will be installing the steelhax exploit.

If this key were completely random, the encryption key would be impossible to break on current computing hardware. Fortunately, the first half of the key (`movable_part1.sed`) is actually mathematically related to your device's Friend Code, allowing us to break the encryption. For information on how Seedminer works, please see [this presentation](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34â…•c3).

Note that this tool requires a PC with a powerful graphics card to break your device's DSiWare encryption. If you do not have access to one of these, there exists an online helper service where a volunteer running automated software will do this for you.

To use the [magnet](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

To extract the `.7z` and `.rar` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

If you already have Steel Diver: Sub Wars, this process will overwrite your game's save file!

### What You Need

* The free eShop game "Steel Diver: Sub Wars" from the eShop
* The latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [Steelhax](https://github.com/VegaRoXas/vegaroxas.github.io/raw/master/files/steelhax-installer.rar)
* The [otherapp payload](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/#otherapp) *(for your region and version)*

### Instructions

#### Section I - Compatibility Test

1. Go to System Settings, then "Internet Settings", then "Nintendo DS Connections"
1. Press "OK"
1. If your device loads into a "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Setup" menu, exit this menu
  + If the screen stays black or appears to freeze, you will not be able to use Frogminer; return to [Get Started](get-started) and select an "All Versions" method
1. Power off your device

#### Section II - Gathering Data

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
1. Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
  + If you see multiple folders like this, perform the following:
  + Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder to `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS`
  + Reinsert your SD card into your device and power on your device
  + Wait for the device to generate the SD card data
  + Power off your device and reinsert your SD card into your computer
  + Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
  + Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
  + Delete the `Nintendo 3DS` folder
  + Rename the `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS` folder to `Nintendo 3DS`
1. Paste your 32 character long folder name into a document you can reference later
  + This folder name is also known as your "ID0"
1. Power on your device
1. Go to your Friend List (the [orange Face Icon]({{ "/images/friend-list-icon.png" | absolute_url }}) in the top row of your Home Menu)
  + If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, you either must create a new Mii or your console cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues)
1. Find your Mii profile, then find the "Friend Code" field on the top screen

#### Section III - Seedminer

1. Open [Bruteforce Movable](https://bruteforcemovable.com/) on your computer
  + This site can automate the retrieval of `movable_part1.sed` (using a bot 3DS console) and the breaking of your device's DSiWare encryption (using a volunteer's computer to run Seedminer)
  + If you already have access to a 3DS capable of launching the Homebrew Launcher, you can manually retrieve your `movable_part1.sed` using that device by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section1) instructions
  + If you already have access to a PC with a powerful graphics card, you can manually calculate your `movable.sed` using it by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section2) instructions
  + If the automated service is nonfunctional and you cannot do one or both of those manually, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. Enter your device's Friend Code (with no spaces or dashes) into the "Your friend code" field
1. Paste your device's 32 character long folder name into the "Your ID0" field
1. Complete the "I'm not a robot" captcha
1. Select "Go"
  + If the site immediately goes to step 4, download your `movable.sed` file and continue with the next section.
1. When prompted, use the "Register Friend" button on your device to add the friend code of the bot 3DS console
1. Wait for the site to update
  + If it does not, wait a few minutes before refreshing the page once
1. Select "Continue"
1. Wait for the process to complete
  + This can take a while (up to an hour in some cases)
  + During this process, the bot may not show up on your 3ds. As long as the website updates, this is not an issue.
  + If you are still waiting after an hour, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. When the process has completed, download your `movable.sed` file from the site

#### Section IV - Steelminer Prep Work

  + **EUR Region**: `000d7e00`
  + **JPN Region**: `000d7c00`
  + **USA Region**: `000d7d00`
1. Copy the new downloaded save file to the `data` folder on your SD card
  + Overwrite the old save file when prompted
